Long:
- Allow calling Prolog code from Enki
    - This is mostly done, but we still need to allow importing prolog files other than just base.pl
- Add code analysis stuff
- Add a GUI library
    - Probably will have to wait until after we can call arbitrary Prolog code from Enki

Medium:
- Use a proper argument parsing library
- Give access to command line arguments to Enki programs
- Improve error messages
- Improve builtin stuff so we don't have to write using the literal Haskell syntax

Short:
-
