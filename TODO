Long:
- Allow calling Prolog code from Enki
    - This will also let us extract out the code for defining builts in that's currently in the TypeChecker.
- Add code analysis stuff
- Add a GUI library
    - Probably will have to wait until after we can call arbitrary Prolog code from Enki

Medium:
- Use a proper argument parsing library
- Give access to command line arguments to Enki programs
- Improve error messages

Short:
-
